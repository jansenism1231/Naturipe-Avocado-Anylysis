# **Avocado Supply Prediction**

## **Introduction**
This project aims to predict avocado supply volumes using machine learning techniques with a focus on seasonality, temporal patterns, and environmental factors. By incorporating features like lagged values, rolling statistics, and Fourier-transformed seasonality indices. the model succeed in capture both short-term trends and long-term seasonal variations uwith the past data. However, the futue data prediction encounter difficulties due to lack of data and useful features.

## **Project Objectives**
1. Develop a robust forecasting solution for supply volume trends.
2. Leverage state-of-the-art models (machine learning, time series, neural networks) to identify patterns and provide reliable future predictions.
3. Provide interpretable results to Naturipe through a mix of statistical analyses and visualizations.

## **Analysis Conducted**
In addition to the models, we conducted detailed data analysis to enhance understanding and performance:

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values by averaging differences across data points.
- Scaled features using `MinMaxScaler` for models requiring normalized input.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Extracted temporal features such as `DayOfYear`, `WeekOfYear`, `Month`, and `DayOfWeek`.
- Used lagged features (e.g., `Supply_lag_1`, `Supply_lag_7`) to capture dependencies in sequential data.

### **3. Regularization**
- Applied L1 and L2 regularization in LightGBM to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

### **4. Evaluation Metrics**
- **RÂ²** (Coefficient of Determination): Assesses model fit quality.
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures prediction accuracy.
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): Evaluates prediction consistency.

### **5. Visualization**
- Plotted actual vs. predicted supply trends for all models.
- Included future supply forecasts with adjustable time periods.
